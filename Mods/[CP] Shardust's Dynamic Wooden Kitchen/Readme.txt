Shardust's Dynamic Wooden Kitchen

This a series of retextures of the game's Kitchen.
The Kitchen has been broken down to 3(x2) different parts, each coming with a variety of textures and colors to mix and match, and will differ slightly according to the Farmhouse Upgrades you have bought.

Requires SMAPI and Content Patcher and was tested with the currently STABLE (at the time of the upload) version of the game. 

Start the game once and it will generate a config.json file inside the mod folder. You can change the textures and colors from those available from there.
